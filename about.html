            <h2 class="mb-4">Frontend Developer, based in the Netherlands.</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">
              A dynamic and determined individual with a rich and diverse
              background. I was born and raised in the picturesque landscapes of
              Slovenia, where my journey towards self-discovery and career
              growth began. After completing my high school education in
              Koƒçevje, I pursued my studies at a prestigious university in
              Ljubljana, earning a degree that equipped me with valuable
              knowledge and skills. But my thirst for exploration and passion
              for creativity led me to embark on a different path - the world of
              tattoos. <br /><br />
              With an unwavering commitment to my interests, I embraced a tattoo
              apprenticeship, expressing my artistic abilities and gaining a
              deeper understanding of the industry. This journey of
              self-expression and artistry helped shape my personality and
              approach to life.
              <br /><br />Driven by a sense of adventure and an eagerness to
              embrace new opportunities, Ia set my sights on Amsterdam, a
              vibrant city known for its artistic culture and innovation. Here,
              I found myself immersed in the world of retail, starting from the
              ground up and working my way to the esteemed position of a
              manager. My dedication, leadership skills, and customer-oriented
              mindset allowed me to excel in this role, leaving a positive
              impact on both my team and clientele. <br /><br />However, my
              passion for technology and an ever-evolving IT landscape beckoned
              me to explore new horizons. Eager to blend my previous experiences
              with my growing interest in IT, I began my journey of pivoting my
              career. <br /><br />Now, as I set my sights on the world of
              Information Technology, I bring with me a unique blend of
              creativity, problem-solving, and leadership skills. My experience
              in retail management has taught me the art of adaptability, making
              me a valuable asset in the dynamic and fast-paced IT industry.
              <br /><br />With a determined spirit and a thirst for continuous
              learning, I am actively seeking opportunities to harness my
              transferable skills and enthusiasm for IT. Armed with a strong
              foundation in customer service, problem-solving, and team
              collaboration, I'm ready to embrace new challenges and make a
              meaningful impact in the world of technology. <br /><br />In the
              midst of my career growth, I immersed myself again in love for
              caring for animals, especially dogs. During my free time, I offer
              dog sitting services to friends and neighbors, nurturing a loyal
              clientele who admired my affectionate and responsible approach to
              pet care. My compassionate nature and ability to establish strong
              bonds with four-legged friends made me a trusted companion to many
              beloved pets. <br /><br />In addition to my love for dogs, I am
              also deeply passionate about fitness and well-being. I find solace
              in the art of yoga, which not only nurtures her physical strength
              but also brings a sense of balance and mindfulness to my life. For
              an invigorating workout, I enjoy attending boxing classes, where I
              push my limits and find motivation in the company of like-minded
              individuals. <br /><br />But that's not all‚ÄîI am also an excellent
              chef and pastry baker. In my kitchen, I artfully create delicious
              and mouthwatering dishes, delighting family and friends with my
              culinary talents. From savory meals to delectable desserts, my
              cooking skills have earned me a reputation as a true food
              connoisseur. <br /><br />With a zest for life and a diverse range
              of interests, I continue to explore the vibrant culture of
              Amsterdam, discover hidden art gems, and nurture her love for
              creativity in all its forms.I firmly believe that each experience
              in life, no matter how diverse, contributes to my growth and makes
              my a stronger and more well-rounded individual. <br /><br />My
              journey exemplifies the power of passion, resilience, and
              adaptability. As I venture forth into the realm of IT, I am
              destined to leave my mark on the digital landscape, crafting a
              unique and inspiring career path that reflects my innate spirit of
              exploration and pursuit of excellence.
